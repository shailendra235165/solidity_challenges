# Project Title

Token Minting and Burning

## Description

This code presents a smart contract in Solidity called "MyToken". It defines three variables, including token name, abbreviation, and total supply, which are publicly accessible. The contract also defines a mapping variable called "balances" with the key as the address and value as an unsigned integer. The "mint" function is used to add tokens to an account, while the "burn" function deducts tokens from an account. The video demonstrates deploying the program, minting tokens, and burning tokens, with corresponding updates to the balance. The license used in the project is the MIT license.
